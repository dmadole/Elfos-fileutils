# Elf/OS File Utilities

> [!NOTE]
>This repository uses submodules for the individual command repositories. You can have these pulled automatically if you add the  --recurse option to your git clone command.

This is a master repository for my file utilities for Elf/OS that will pull and build all included commands at once, including building an lbr archive file of them (by using `make lbr`).

Building an lbr requires the lbradd script installed on the build system, which can be found at https://github.com/dmadole/lbradd
